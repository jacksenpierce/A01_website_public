  <h1>Publishing the first unified lab index</h1>
  <p class="post-meta">May 10, 2024 Â· Release</p>
</header>
  <p>
    The first iteration of our lab notebook index ships with static search data and project cross-links, making it easy
    to trace experiments by aim or related feature work. The index reads from lab entry metadata, which keeps the
    presentation layer thin and maintainable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Future updates will automate the generation of summaries and highlight notable experiment outcomes. For now, the
    static approach keeps load times negligible while providing the connective tissue between ongoing research and public
    documentation.
