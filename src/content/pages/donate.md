Normal Rooms is free to read and host. If you’d like to support ongoing research synthesis, consider one of the options below:

- [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for recurring contributions.
- [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for one-off boosts.

We keep supporters updated through the blog and project hubs—no additional mailing lists or tracking pixels.
