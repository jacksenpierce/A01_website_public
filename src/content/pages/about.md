Normal Rooms exists to keep product, research, and operations aligned through a single static site. Every page is generated ahead of time and deployed to GitHub Pages for durability.

The project leans on the Docusaurus mental model—docs, blog, custom pages—to ensure future expansion remains straightforward. Contributors author Markdown/MDX files once and let the build surface the right format for each idiom.
