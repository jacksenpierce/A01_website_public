A small shared vocabulary of tags keeps the site navigable. Project leads maintain the taxonomy, review incoming documents, and ensure every change includes updated cross references. Release notes appear on the blog, while decisions that affect policy land in the wiki for permanent reference.

The lab notebook remains append-only to preserve experiment history. Projects link to relevant lab entries and posts via tags, building a durable knowledge graph.
