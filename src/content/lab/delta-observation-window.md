  aim: Validate that the static delta visualization remains legible during rapid content updates.
  method: Generated synthetic commits in the docs folder and rebuilt the site to monitor visual stability.

  next: Document the rebuild guardrails in the wiki and reference them from the project hub.
summary: Search index rebuilds stayed fast and the delta visualization held steady during rapid updates.
