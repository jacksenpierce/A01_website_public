  aim: Confirm the landing gate improves clarity without blocking known contributors.
  method: Ran remote tests with five participants comparing direct vs gated entry to the site.
  observations: Participants appreciated the calm aesthetic; no confusion about the ENTER action.
  result: Gate retained; copy updated to highlight the siteâ€™s three idioms.
  next: Roll the copy updates into the landing page and document the decision in the wiki.
summary: Remote testing validated the landing gate copy and kept the calm entry point intact.
