Welcome to Normal Rooms, the static knowledge hub for our ongoing experiments. The wiki, blog, and lab notebook now live together with shared navigation and styling, making it easy to move between evergreen documentation and time-based updates.

This launch also debuts the gated landing page for first-time visitors. It sets the tone and keeps the home page focused on ongoing work.
