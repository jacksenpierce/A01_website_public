  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Normal Rooms</strong> is a static-first publishing initiative that emphasizes predictable deployments,
    human-readable URLs, and a unified Markdown substrate. All content is rendered at build time to guarantee fast
    delivery on GitHub Pages without runtime dependencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    The documentation corpus is organized into topical articles that cross-link using a shared tag vocabulary. This
    structure mirrors the navigation patterns of Wikipedia, helping contributors and readers move intuitively between
    reference pages, project hubs, and release notes.

  <h2>Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    Normal Rooms adapts <em>Docusaurus</em>-style conventions to keep the knowledge base cohesive. Content is split into
    wiki articles, blog posts, lab notebook entries, and project hubs. Each artifact is stored once in the repository and
    rendered into multiple surfaces through declarative metadata and linking.
  </p>
  <p>
    The static site uses light-weight components and progressive enhancement. Navigation chrome is shared across all
    pages, while modules such as the wiki and blog render their own layouts. Because everything compiles to static
    assets, the site remains resilient and cacheable.

  <h2>Publishing workflow</h2>
  <p>
    Authors write documents in the <code>content/wiki</code> directory using HTML or Markdown-compatible fragments. A build
    script (or manual copy for GitHub Pages) hydrates those fragments into the wiki module. Blog posts follow a similar
    pattern within <code>content/blog</code>, making it straightforward to add new entries without editing layout code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to deployment, integrity checks ensure that navigation indexes, search data, and cross-links remain valid. The
    generated static assets can be previewed locally and deployed atomically.

  <h2>Governance</h2>
  <p>
    A small editorial group curates the tag taxonomy, reviews incoming documents, and maintains cross-references between
    wiki articles, blog posts, and lab updates. Long-lived decisions are recorded in the wiki, while milestones appear on
    the blog. Experiments stay in the lab notebook to preserve chronological context.
