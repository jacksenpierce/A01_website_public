  <p>
    We consolidated the static publishing workflow with the lab notebook schedule, ensuring experiment learnings
    propagate to the wiki and project hubs without duplicated content. Each module now reads from the shared
    <code>content</code> directory, so adding a new article or post only requires updating metadata files and committing the
    document fragment.
  </p>
  <p>
    By aligning publishing cadence with research milestones, the team can announce results on the blog while immediately
    updating the wiki reference material. Tags provide the connective tissue: lab entries, project hubs, and wiki
    articles all reference the same taxonomy for quick navigation.
