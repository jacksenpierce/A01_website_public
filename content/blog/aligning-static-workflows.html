    We consolidated the static publishing workflow with the lab notebook schedule, ensuring experiment learnings
    propagate to the wiki and project hubs without duplicated content. Each module now reads from the shared
    <code>content</code> directory, so adding a new article or post only requires updating metadata files and committing the
    document fragment.

    By aligning publishing cadence with research milestones, the team can announce results on the blog while immediately
    updating the wiki reference material. Tags provide the connective tissue: lab entries, project hubs, and wiki
    articles all reference the same taxonomy for quick navigation.
