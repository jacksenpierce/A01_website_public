    The Normal Rooms knowledge hub brings together documentation idioms that traditionally live in separate systems. The
    wiki holds evergreen reference material, the blog publishes major milestones, the lab notebook logs experiments, and
    project hubs aggregate deliverables. All four surfaces draw from the same repository, which keeps the contribution
    story simple.

  <p>
    We are iterating toward a fully automated publishing flow. In the meantime, the modular structure already mirrors the
    expectations people have when navigating a wiki or a canonical blog. That familiarity is deliberate—clarity beats
    novelty when sharing institutional knowledge.
