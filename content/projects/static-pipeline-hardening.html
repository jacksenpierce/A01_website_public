  <h2>Focus</h2>
  <p>
    We are fortifying the static publishing pipeline so that every deploy ships with a fresh search index, verified
    cross-links, and reproducible build artifacts. The project curates scripts, checklists, and dashboards that surface
    reliability signals before they reach production.

  <h2>Current emphasis</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Track build inputs and outputs to ensure we can diff static assets between releases.</li>
    <li>Automate link and accessibility validation as part of the pre-deploy checklist.</li>
    <li>Document the release posture in the wiki so new contributors can reason about the guardrails.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Signals surfaced here</h2>
  <p>
    This project foregrounds operational health: search index freshness, build duration, and link integrity. It pulls in
    experiment logs from the lab notebook and describes how they map back to the production workflow.
