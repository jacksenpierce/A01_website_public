  <h2>Focus</h2>
  <p>
    We steward the entrance to the site so that the gray-and-orange theme feels calm, welcoming, and consistent across
    devices. The project records experiments that shape the initial impression visitors receive before entering the
    knowledge base.

  <h2>Current emphasis</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Prototype responsive layouts that preserve the visual balance on phones, tablets, and large screens.</li>
    <li>Document rationale for copy, interactions, and transitions so future updates stay aligned with the tone.</li>
    <li>Share learnings from usability studies with the rest of the modules, especially the wikiâ€™s first-run experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Signals surfaced here</h2>
  <p>
    This projection foregrounds perception: how the gate establishes trust, how quickly visitors can orient, and which
    interactions deserve animation. It keeps the design vocabulary synchronized with the rest of the site.
