  <h2>Focus</h2>
  <p>
    We maintain the connective tissue across the wiki, blog, and project modules. That means refining the shared tag
    vocabulary, mapping identifiers between experiments, and documenting the conventions that keep the graph legible.

  <h2>Current emphasis</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Audit cross-module links and repair outdated references as the taxonomy evolves.</li>
    <li>Define naming patterns for experiments, releases, and projects so related work is easy to surface.</li>
    <li>Publish governance notes describing how to propose new tags or retire legacy ones.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Signals surfaced here</h2>
  <p>
    This projection highlights relational integrity: which topics connect, how tags cluster, and where documentation
    should expand next. It synthesizes governance notes, onboarding material, and architecture references.
